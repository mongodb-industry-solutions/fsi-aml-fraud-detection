After risk scoring, if decision is **ESCALATE** or **BLOCK**, invoke **SuspiciousReportsAgent** with case info:

* **Transactions**: type, amount, frequency, counterparties, channels.
* **Tool findings**: sanctions, PEP, adverse media, anomaly/network checks.
* **Customer**: new/existing, history, prior alerts, risk rating.
* **Behavior**: deviations, unusual patterns, high-risk links.

Request from agent:

* Relevant past SARs/investigations.
* Applicable AML/Fraud policy docs or regulatory guidance.
* Typologies/red flags (structuring, layering, funneling, TBML, sanctions evasion).
* Match strength (**High/Moderate/Weak**) with justification.
* Contextual insights + policy-aligned recommendations.

Output must follow **SuspiciousReportsAgent response template** for integration.
