After risk scoring, if the decision is **ESCALATE** or **BLOCK**, invoke the **SuspiciousReportsAgent**.

When invoking, provide **detailed case information**, including:

* **Transaction details**: transaction type(s), amount(s), frequency, counterparties, channels used.
* **Tool call findings**: results from sanctions screening, adverse media, PEP checks, anomaly detection, network analysis, or other investigative tools.
* **Customer profile**: whether the customer is new or existing, account history, previous alerts, and risk rating.
* **Behavioral context**: deviations from typical activity, unusual transaction patterns, links to known high-risk entities.

Request the following from the SuspiciousReportsAgent:

* Relevant past SARs or investigations related to the customer, counterparties, or transaction patterns.
* Common typologies or red-flag patterns associated with the activity (e.g., structuring, layering, funnel accounts, trade-based ML, sanctions evasion).
* Match strength assessment (**High / Moderate / Weak**) based on similarity to known cases.
* Contextual insights and recommendations for the investigator to guide the final decision.

Require output in the **SuspiciousReportsAgent response template** for seamless integration into the final decision workflow.
