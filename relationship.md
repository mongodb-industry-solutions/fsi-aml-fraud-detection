### Expanded Summary: `relationships` Collection

**Total Documents Created:** 140

This collection is designed to explicitly define the connections (the "edges") between the documents in the `entities` collection (the "nodes"). By creating a dedicated collection for these edges, you can model complex, many-to-many connections and add rich, descriptive data to each link in your network graph.

#### Data Model / Schema

The schema for the `relationships` collection is designed to capture the nature, strength, and context of each link. Key fields include:

- **`_id`**: A unique `ObjectId()` for the relationship document itself.
- **`relationshipId`**: A unique string identifier for the relationship (e.g., "REL" + random characters).
- **`source`**: An object containing the `entityId` and `entityType` of the relationship's starting point.
- **`target`**: An object containing the `entityId` and `entityType` of the relationship's endpoint.
- **`type`**: A string that describes the semantic nature of the connection. The notebook generates various types, such as `confirmed_same_entity`, `director_of`, `shareholder_of`, `household_member`, and `transactional_counterparty_high_risk`.
- **`direction`**: A string indicating if the link is `"bidirectional"` (applies equally to both entities) or `"directed"` (flows from source to target).
- **`strength`**: A numerical score from 0 to 1 that indicates the strength of the link, especially for inferred or potential connections.
- **`active`**: A boolean flag to indicate if the relationship is currently active. The script also generates some inactive relationships with a `validTo` date in the past to model temporal changes in the network.
- **`verified`**: A boolean indicating if the relationship has been confirmed by an analyst or a trusted data source.
- **`evidence`**: An array of objects detailing the proof behind the relationship, such as which attributes matched (`"attribute_match"`) or the source of the information (`"company_registry_simulated"`).
- **`datasource`**: A string indicating where the relationship data originated, for example, `"entity_resolution_engine_v3"` or `"intelligence_leak_simulated_v2"`.
- **`confidence`**: A numerical score representing the confidence level in the accuracy of the established link.

#### Nature of Generated Relationships

The 140 unique relationships are not random; they are intelligently generated to create a realistic and interconnected network based on the entity scenarios:

- **Entity Resolution Links**: For every "Clear Duplicate" and "Subtle Duplicate" entity set, corresponding relationships of type `confirmed_same_entity` or `potential_duplicate` are created to link them together.
- **Corporate Structure Links**: For the "Complex Org Structures" and "Shell Company" scenarios, the script generates `director_of`, `ubo_of`, and `parent_of_subsidiary` relationships to map out the corporate hierarchies and ownership chains.
- **Household Links**: For entities sharing a primary address in the "Household Sets" scenario, `household_member` relationships are created.
- **High-Risk Network Links**: The script intentionally creates speculative and high-risk connections to build a network for analysis. This includes linking PEPs to HNWIs (`business_associate_suspected`), PEPs to shell companies (`potential_beneficial_owner_of`), and sanctioned organizations to other entities (`transactional_counterparty_high_risk`).
- **Generic & Historical Links**: To add density and realism to the graph, a number of generic `"professional_colleague_public"` or `"social_media_connection_public"` links are created. Furthermore, some relationships are intentionally made inactive (e.g., a past directorship) to demonstrate how a network graph can evolve over time.
