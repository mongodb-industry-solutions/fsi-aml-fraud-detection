   - Simple threshold-based routing to Stage 2

3. **Stage 2: Vector Search + AI Analysis** (`stage2_analyzer.py`)
   - Integration with existing vector similarity search
   - AI-powered pattern analysis using Azure OpenAI
   - Final decision synthesis

4. **Core Models** (`models.py`)
   - Simplified decision models
   - Remove complex ML scoring models
   - Focus on essential transaction and decision data

### Phase 2: Enhanced Tools & Functions (Medium Priority)
**Goal**: Add intelligent analysis capabilities
**Timeline**: After Phase 1 completion

**Components**:
1. **Agent Tools** (`tools/`)
   - `transaction_patterns.py`: Historical pattern analysis
   - `sanctions_checker.py`: Basic sanctions list checking
   - `network_analyzer.py`: Customer network risk assessment

2. **Enhanced Decision Logic**
   - Confidence scoring improvements
   - Multi-factor risk assessment
   - Learning from previous decisions

### Phase 3: Demo Polish & Integration (Low Priority)
**Goal**: Demo-ready features and UI integration
**Timeline**: Final phase

**Components**:
1. **API Integration** (`api_endpoints.py`)
   - REST endpoints for frontend integration
   - Async processing for better UX
   - Simple status tracking

2. **Demo Features**
   - Performance metrics dashboard
   - Decision explanation interfaces
   - Simple configuration management
