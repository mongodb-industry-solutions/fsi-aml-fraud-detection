## Implementation Details

### Vector Embedding System

- Implemented using sentence-transformers with the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model
- Transaction fields (amount, currency, location) are combined and vectorized
- MongoDB vector search index is automatically created on startup
- Robust error handling for database operations, including automatic collection creation
- Vector search is a required component and the system will not operate without it
- Clear error messaging when vector search capabilities are not available

### Fraud Detection Methods

1. **Rules-Based Detection**

   - Configurable high-risk locations with weighting
   - Configurable amount threshold with weighting
   - Fraud score calculation with customizable weights
   - Transaction is flagged (is_flagged_fraud = True) if fraud_score ≥ 0.5

2. **Vector-Based Detection**
   - Uses MongoDB $vectorSearch aggregation to find similar transactions
   - Computes fraud likelihood based on similar transaction patterns
   - Returns top 5 similar transactions for inspection
   - similarity_fraud_score is calculated as the average fraud_score of 5 most similar transactions
   - Transaction is flagged (is_flagged_fraud_similarity = True) if similarity_fraud_score ≥ 0.5
   - Requires ideally 500+ transactions with varied patterns for robust detection
   - Returns 0.0 if fewer than 5 transactions exist in database

### MongoDB Schema Design

- **transactions collection**: Stores transaction data with embedded vector embeddings
- **fraud_detection_rules collection**: Stores configurable fraud detection rules

### API Endpoints

- `GET /transactions` - Get transaction history
- `POST /transactions` - Create new transaction
- `POST /transactions/generate-samples` - Generate sample transactions
- `GET /fraud-rules` - Get current fraud detection rules
- `PUT /fraud-rules` - Update fraud detection rules
- `POST /fraud-rules/reset` - Reset rules to defaults

### Frontend Features

- Interactive transaction creation form with amount, currency, and location
- Real-time fraud detection with visual comparison of both methods
- Transaction history table with filtering options
- Sample data generation capabilities

## Technical Decisions

1. **Singleton Pattern for Embedding Model**

   - Sentence transformer model is loaded once and reused to improve performance
   - Implemented using Python's **new** method

2. **Dependency Injection for Services**

   - MongoDB collections are injected into services to improve testability
   - API endpoints use FastAPI dependency system for service creation

3. **Error Handling**

   - Comprehensive try/except blocks with detailed error messages
   - Consistent error response structure across all API endpoints

4. **Docker Configuration**

   - Added system dependencies for sentence-transformers
   - Environment variable management with defaults
   - Volume mounting for .env file

5. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear separation between models, services, and API endpoints
   - Modular architecture for easy maintenance and extension
