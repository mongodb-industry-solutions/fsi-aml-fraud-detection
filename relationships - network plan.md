The `relationships` collection serves as the dedicated edge collection for network graph operations, optimized for MongoDB's graph capabilities.

#### Essential Fields

- **`_id`**: Unique `ObjectId()` for the relationship document
- **`relationshipId`**: Unique string identifier (format: "REL" + random characters)
- **`source`**: Object containing `entityId` and `entityType` of relationship origin
- **`target`**: Object containing `entityId` and `entityType` of relationship destination
- **`type`**: Semantic relationship type (see Network Relationship Types below)
- **`direction`**: "bidirectional" or "directed" relationship flow
- **`strength`**: Numerical score (0-1) indicating relationship strength
- **`confidence`**: Numerical score (0-1) representing confidence level
- **`active`**: Boolean flag for relationship status
- **`verified`**: Boolean indicating analyst/system verification
- **`evidence`**: Array of evidence objects supporting the relationship
- **`datasource`**: Source system identifier
- **`validFrom`/`validTo`**: Optional temporal validity fields

#### Network Relationship Types

**Entity Resolution:**
- `confirmed_same_entity` - Verified duplicate entities
- `potential_duplicate` - Suspected duplicate entities

**Corporate Structure:**
- `director_of` - Directorship relationships  
- `ubo_of` - Ultimate beneficial ownership

### Database Optimization

#### Indexes for Graph Operations
```javascript
// Core graph traversal indexes
{source.entityId: 1, type: 1, active: 1}
{target.entityId: 1, type: 1, active: 1}
{source.entityId: 1, target.entityId: 1, type: 1}

// Performance indexes
{type: 1, strength: 1, confidence: -1}
{datasource: 1, confidence: -1}
{verified: 1, evidence.attribute_match: 1}
```

## Advanced Network Operations

### Graph Traversal with $graphLookup

The implementation uses MongoDB's $graphLookup for efficient multi-hop relationship discovery:

```python
# Outgoing relationships traversal
{
    "$graphLookup": {
        "from": "relationships",
        "startWith": entity_id,
        "connectFromField": "target.entityId",
        "connectToField": "source.entityId", 
        "as": "outgoing_relationships",
        "maxDepth": max_depth - 1,
        "restrictSearchWithMatch": {"active": True, "type": {"$in": relationship_types}}
    }
}
```

### Risk Assessment Framework

**Risk Weight Factors:**
- `transactional_counterparty_high_risk`: 0.9
- `business_associate_suspected`: 0.7
- `potential_beneficial_owner_of`: 0.8
- `confirmed_same_entity`: 0.95
- `director_of`: 0.6
- `shareholder_of`: 0.5

**Risk Calculation:**
```python
risk_score = (
    high_risk_ratio * 0.5 +
    unverified_ratio * 0.2 + 
    beneficial_ownership_ratio * 0.3
)
```

### Network Pattern Detection

**Automated Pattern Recognition:**
1. **Corporate Hierarchies** - Director, shareholder, subsidiary relationships
2. **Beneficial Ownership Chains** - UBO and ownership connection patterns
3. **Household Clusters** - Shared address relationship groups
4. **Duplicate Entity Groups** - Same entity and potential duplicate links
5. **High-Risk Networks** - Suspicious connection patterns

## API Integration

### Network Analysis Endpoints

The services integrate with FastAPI routes providing:

- **Connection Path Discovery** - `/network/paths/{source_id}/{target_id}`
- **Cluster Detection** - `/network/clusters`
- **Risk Assessment** - `/network/risk/{entity_id}`
